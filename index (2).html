                <h3> Finishing School</h3>
                <p>
                  Finishing School
                  The purpose of the Finishing School is to train students to be industry ready and adapt to changes,
                  teach them skills to face interviews and to groom students. This unique program given by the Finishing
                  School is largely appreciated by students and parents. These programs embedded into the curriculum,
                  teaches lifeline skills- manners, etiquette, spoken English and other skills like singing, debating,
                  group discussion and aptitude programs. Grooming lessons are taught and enforced right from the day
                  one. Yoga, aerobics, silambam and singing classes are compulsory. To induce creativity, sand
                  sculpting, clay modeling and chart making sessions are also conducted. These activities are designed

              <h3>Test & Tutorials</h3>

              <p>

                Special evening tuition classes and extensive re-testing are conducted regularly. The Daily Assessment
                Test (DAT) is a daily testing feature to induce the students to study the subjects taught during the
                previous week. Cyclic Assessment Tests (CAT) are also conducted twice a semester. Weak students are
                spotted out for compulsory coaching. Study camps are organized during study holidays to help students
                get their doubts cleared from teachers without hesitation. These informal tuition sessions, which are
                conducted with small group of students, have proven to be highly successful.

              Its administration is highly decentralized giving way for efficiency and development. Academics and
              administration are clearly demarcated to even out load-bearing. As a result, all round development of
              curriculum is easily carried forth without strain or difficulty by each and every responsibility head.

            <h3>Spoken English</h3>
            <p>

              Disciplined grooming along with compulsory spoken English has made this institution unique. Students are
              actually compelled to speak in English with proper supervision and counselling. Hence, our efforts on the
              “Spoken English” front has largely proved to be very productive. Classes are strictly taken in English.
              Finishing School and communication enhancement programs like singing classes, panel debates, group
              discussions, movie classes, topic presentation, language lab sessions have further helped students to
              drastically improve their English communication skills.

            <p>

              Almost 85% to 90% of the students get placed annually by way of Campus Interviews. About 10 to 13
              corporate companies visit the campus every year for recruitment apart from off-campus interviewers. The
              students are trained right from the first year by way of Finishing School classes. Prior to recruitment
              they are given intensive coaching in aptitude tests and interview process. This gives them the much needed
              confidence to face interviews.
